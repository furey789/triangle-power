        This is a short website motivated by my interest in education and my desire to learn web app development via Javascript. The topic is geometry and the idea is that most of us learn geometry without knowing much about where it comes from and how it fits into the world. 
        <!--         Page layout and presentation (via CSS) is not fancy nor perfect because my focus is more on interactivity. -->

        And let's face it. This is fine for those of us that genuinely like math, 
        but for the rest of us, it makes math uninteresting and seemingly more
        abstract than it already is.

        Geometry connects to a broad range of subjects - 
        from history, to language, science, art, and beyond. Let's find out how by
        looking at triangles.
