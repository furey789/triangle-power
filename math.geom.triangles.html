            reduces the percentage of water. Why? Because some water evaporates. The 
            percentages of flour and chocolate also change, since the water percentage
            changes and the total of all three percentages must be 100. The 
            amounts of flour and chocolate in the batter remain the same during cooking, 
            and this feature is expressed by the ratio of their percentages, which
            also remains the same.

            The harp is one of the earliest stringed instruments and 
            dates back to Ancient Egypt circa 2500 BC.

            <p class="t2">Not surprisingly, the harp is triangular. 
            The triangular shape allows for strings of different lengths 
            to be placed in succession, from largest to smallest. This arrangement leads 
            to a similar succession of musical notes, from lowest to highest. 
            This order facilitates playing a harp, since it would be challenging to 
            play one if note order was not so logical.

            The Right Triangle below represents a harp with four strings.
            <!-- and serves to illustrate the logical nature of the harp as explained above.-->

            Click on buttons S1, S2, and S4. Button S1 gives the sound of a C note for 
            the short string in blue. String S2 is 2 times the length of string
            S1 and gives the sound of a C note that is one octave lower. This same
            effect occurs when doubling string S2 to get string S4. The sound of S4
            is one octave lower than that of S2. Doubling string length
            to obtain an octave difference in sound holds in the real world, given 
            that strings are made of the same material and have the same thickness.
            </p>
            <p class="t2">
            We can write an equation for the relationship between string 
            length and musical note. Let <i> L<sub>0</sub> </i> be the length of string S1 and
            <i>n</i> be the number of octaves above the note for the string. Then, 
            string length <i>L</i> depends on <i>n</i> as 
            <i>L(n) = 2<sup> n</sup>L<sub>0</sub></i>.

            Click on button S3. String S3 is 3 times longer than the string S1.
            It gives an F-sharp note that is between the C notes of strings S2 and S4.

            As shown above, the strings of our harp define four smaller 
            triangles placed within the harp body. The body of our harp
            and these four smaller triangles are <b>self-similar objects</b>, 
            meaning that they're identical in shape
            and each one is simply a re-scaled (enlarged or shrunken) version 
            of the others.
            </p>
            <p class="t2">
            Since the triangles are self-similar, if we double the length
            of string S1 to get string S2, then we also double the base of triangle
            S1 to get the base of triangle S2. This pattern holds when we take 3 and 4 times
            the length of string S1. As a result, the distance between each of the
            strings, along the base of our harp, is the same. This feature will hold if
            the lower right angle of our harp takes on any value between 0 and 90
            degrees.

            There's an interesting connection between forces on an object and triangles.
            In the circle below is a dot that we can think of as a brown boat in a circular
            ocean. Let's suppose that the boat moves in a direction that is 
            influenced by three forces: wind, ocean tide, and its own motor. Assume that these forces, when added, produce the net force on the boat.
            </p>
            <p class="t2">
            Click on Wind & Tide and two arrows appear, each extending away from the boat.
            The black arrow shows the direction of wind and its
            length represents wind strength. Likewise, the blue arrow shows the direction
            and strength of the ocean tide.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Canvas">
            <canvas id="canvas5" width="450" height="400"> 
            </canvas>
            <button id="bwt"> Wind & Tide </button>
            <button id="bdrift1"> Drift </button>
            <button id="bformTriangle"> Form Triangle </button>
        </div>
        <div class="d2">
            <p class="t2">
            Now, click on Drift. As you can see, with wind and 
            ocean tide forces <em>and no motor force</em>, the boat drifts away from the center of
            the ocean. Click on Wind & Tide and Drift buttons again to see 
            different drift conditions due to changes in the wind. Notice that the drift speed slows down as the wind direction becomes more opposing to the tide direction.
            </p>
            <p class="t2">
            What direction and strength of motor force do we need to prevent the boat
            from drifting? Well, we can determine this graphically, and not surprisingly
            a triangle is involved. 
            </p>
            <p class="t2">
            Click on the Form Triangle button and you'll see that the wind arrow has be re-positioned
            so that the tide arrow points to its tail (the grey arrow). Notice that the
            direction and length of the wind arrow remains the same as before. 
            A third orange arrow has been added to form a triangle with the blue and grey
            arrows. This arrow represents the motor force and direction that's
            needed to stop the boat from drifting.
            </p>
            <p class="t2">
            Why does this triangle method work? The x-components of the three arrows
            sum to zero and so do the y-components.

            shown along with a weak motor force (orange arrow). 
            The grey dot shows how far the orange arrow should extend to stop
            boat drift. It represents the arrow determined from the triangle method.
            </p> 
            <p class="t2">
            Click on Drift to see the result of having a weak motor force. 
            Now, adjust the slider to change the motor force, and then click on Wind & Tide & Motor to see it. Click on Drift to see what it does to the boat.
            </p>
            <p class="t2">
